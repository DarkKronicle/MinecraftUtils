# MinecraftUtils

A package of different helpful utilities for dealing with Minecraft.

## Resource Packs

Minecraft changed a lot from 1.12 to 1.13. A big chunk of it was them moving away from block ID's. Now it's all namespaced. Minecraft has zero support for <1.12 resource packs to >1.13 resource packs. To help with this we have created the flattening to convert these resource packs back and forth,and provide other resources.
